# Midrolls Release Notes

### Product Description

Midrolls enables our customers to monetize by serving video ads in the middle of video content, more similar to the TV experience, rather than at the beginning of video content. 

Midrolls are preferrable to pre-rolls as midrolls have less of an impact on video viewing; viewers are less likely to bounce out of a video during an advertisement if the ad comes in the middle of content rather than prior to it. Midrolls are also preferrable to post-rolls as they have higher impression and completion rates.

For information on how to configure midrolls as a customer, see this video-tutorial [here](https://applicaster.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208005076-Configuring-Midrolls).

As a support agentor PM, for information how to enable the fields for midrolls configuration, see this documentation [here](https://applicaster.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207983116-How-to-setup-midroll-fields-in-extensions).
