### The Process
### 1. Pick a Zapp Layout
- Define which existing Zapp Layout you wish to use.
- Base your decision on the layouts supported features and limitations and match it to your customer’s needs.
- Existing Zapp Layouts (L1-L12, except L11) are both UI and feature-dependent. This means only certain layouts will have support for specific screens, features or content types, such as VODs, Live Programs, EPG, ATOM (Article, Photo Gallery and Video) along with HTML.
- L11 and future Zapp Layouts will be composed of all the possible screens & content types any customer could use/need:
    -   Screens:
        - Homescreen
        - All Shows
        - Show Screen
        - Article Screen
        - Video Article Screen
        - Photo Gallery Screen
        - EPG
        - Mixed Category Screen
        - Breaking News Screen
    - Content Types:
        - VODs
        - Programs
            - Live
            - Future
            - Past
        - EPG
        - ATOM 
            - Article
            - Photo Gallery
            - Video 

### 2. Provide Assets & Styles
-   Work with a designer to create an adaptation of the layout for your app. Provide the designer with:
    - Layout PSD’s from [this folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ypssnz1b6lz0u80/AABXTnPpE_x47cG-GN_c02zoa?dl=0). 
    - Any design materials provided by the customer (Brand guidelines, fonts, etc.).
    - Downloaded Zapp Assets from an existing app based on the chosen Layout or alternatively, there are white-label assets under the respective Layout folder in [this link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bz61HeYk8FoKWmhKRm9MMnNCV28&usp=sharing). 
    - Define the required screens based on the existing Zapp Layout’s availability.

- The designer should provide you with: 
    - Adapted design based on the layout (screen PNGs and PSDs).
    - Assets folder for iOS and/or Android (each file should be named “assets.zip”).
    - The designer should respect the naming convention for the file and the assets, the sizes and their order based on the assets file you provided.
    - Fonts in OTF & TTF formats.

### 3. Create the Account
- Request Account Creation
    - Please send an email to support and fill out [this template](https://docs.google.com/a/applicaster.com/spreadsheets/d/1huH5slEp9uWKhylRje88oOtORHo_ADgEjx-YM-8iQaY/edit?usp=sharing).
    - Alternatively, if you want to create the account yourself, make sure you’ve received training from support and are authorized to do so - this is to avoid any future issues with your app - and make sure you always follow the latest documentation.


### 4. Fill out the Zapp App Checklist 
- Create a copy of [this document](https://docs.google.com/a/applicaster.com/document/d/1GN8SvWybBN0NHXh7QcoefJO4gElH-lnXm42CNbWjelI/edit?usp=sharing) and fill it out.
    - For Demo purposes: fill out the brief (p.1 -5).
    - For Store versions: fill out the entire document.



### 5. Set Up the CMS
- Follow the Layout’s Configuration Guide - you may find the Configuration Guide within that Layout’s folder in our [Zapp Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz61HeYk8FoKWmhKRm9MMnNCV28). Basically the process involves:
    - Recreating the exact same VOD Library Content Hierarchy for that Layout,
    - Configuring the exact same collections.
- Additionally, it’s important to ingest or upload the content and assign it to the proper categories.
- Configure:
    - Feature Management
    - Broadcaster Image Settings 
    - Video Dock 
    - VOD Configuration (CDN)

### 6. Set Up Zapp Customization
- Upload assets to Zapp
- Upload font files if the app is using app-specific fonts. Otherwise, define fonts in Styles.
- Customize Zapp Styles (fonts & colors) using the Style Guides provided in the Layout’s Configuration Guide in the [Zapp Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz61HeYk8FoKWmhKRm9MMnNCV28).


### 7. Create Build & Download the App
