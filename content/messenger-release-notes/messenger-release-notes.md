# Messenger App Release Notes

## Product Description

The Messenger app is a combination of the CrossMates Messenger and the GroupChat Messenger products. 

**They both currently sit in one application** but each can be turned off remotely as described in the below release notes.

The Messenger was produced in order to give real life talents and tv stars the ability to post messages (either CrossMates or GroupChat) directly from an iOS smartphone device, instead of having to use the CMS. 

In other words, the Messengers are a native CMS for TV stars.
