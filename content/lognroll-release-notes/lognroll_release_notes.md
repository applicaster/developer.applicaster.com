# logNroll Release Notes

## Product Description

The “logNroll” product allows customers to create a flow including introduction/instruction pages, optional login, and a flow of one or several interactive questions, one after the other. 
This product is especially good for sponsored activities or campaigns with prizes, since there is great real estate before the interactions.Content Manager can easily define and make changes - visibility of the start page and registration form and the list of questions. 


## Alpha Release (December 28th, 2015)
