# Product Release Checklist
The following table describe the items that must be considered by every PO at every product/feature release. 

Not all the items are compulsary to execute for every single release - this would depend on the product level/type etc.

The reason we need this list is in order to align all product releases and to make sure we do not forget any important step when releasing new products.


Item      | Where/How
--------------- | ---------------
Company Announcement* | Announce the new feature / change / product on the company’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/282441801876106/)
Naming| Session with marketing to propose a feature name, to be approved at MOC
Measurement | Follow the [Product Analytics Procedure](http://developer.applicaster.com/docs/internal/product_analytics_procedure) and ensure adequate documentation
Pricing | Pass 1 slide info about the feature to CPO and ensure package/MOU/SOW are updated
Training | Training Session (Support & PM’s primarily, all others optional)
User Manual | Make sure Support has the info and that it is produced in [Zendesk](https://applicaster.zendesk.com/) + how-to video
Release Notes | Write and upload to [Developer Center](http://developer.applicaster.com/)
Customer Notification | Consult with GM’s and PM’s whether specific customers need to be notified BEFORE the release. This applies mainly when the product has UI/functional impact. Notification details should be uploaded to Zendesk. 
Marketing Signoff | Discuss Newsletter, company website, feature website, movie, PR
Update Roadmap Portal | At every stage of the feature (up next/in progress/released) make sure [Roadmap](roadmap.applicaster.com) is updated
