# HTML/JS COVERAGE (JS-2-Morpheus)

### Service Description

JS-2-Morpheus is a service which enables web-products to send analytics events and user profiles to Morpheus, the Applicaster product which handles the delivery of analytics data. This enables web products to gain the same coverage as native analytics events, providing the ability to deliver analytics data to all the providers Morpheus supports as opposed to creating several different integrations directly from each web product. Additionally, the outcome enables analysts to connect the information gathered from the mobile web product with information gathered from the native app and analyze it all in the same place.
