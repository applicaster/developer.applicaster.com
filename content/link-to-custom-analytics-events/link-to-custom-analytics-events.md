# Applicaster Custom Analytics Events

On top of supporting the "out-of-the-box" functionality of the analytics providers Applicaster supports via [Morpheus](http://developer.applicaster.com/docs/public/morpheus), Applicaster also delivers our own custom events to track the particular behavior related to user interactions within our apps.

All of the custom events supported can be found in our catalogue of custom analytics events [here](http://developer.applicaster.com/products-list?docType=Analytics)
