# Morpheus

#### Overview

Other developer documentation refers to an Applicaster called "Morpheus". This document outlines what Morpheus is

#### Product Description
 
Morpheus enables Applicaster to remotely configure which analytics providers to send data to. Users can configure the analytics providers in Zapp. For default analytics providers and providers included prior to compiling the version build, the configuration fields can be changed without a new release.

The aim of Morpheus is to provide greater flexibility and scalability around analytics as opposed to a traditional approach of hardcoded direct integrations.

The infrastructure works as illustrated in the diagram below:
