#  Analytics

Applicaster provides a broad set of custom analytics events to help customers understand their end user behavior and thereby more effectively make data-driven business decisions. These events are sent to behavioral analytics providers and can be found here: [Applicaster Custom Events](http://developer.applicaster.com/products-list?docType=Analytics)

Applicaster handles and delivers analytics data through an internal tool called Morpheus, which you can learn more about [here](http://developer.applicaster.com/docs/public/morpheus).

Morpheus supports a "Plugin" system, where third party analytics providers can be "plugged in" to the system and automatically start receiving all of the events referenced above. Every analytics provider has their own set of "out-of-the-box" functionality and events (i.e. retention reporting, session tracking) as part of their SDK, which Applicaster also supports. 

Applicaster supports the following analytics providers:

* Google Analytics
* Mixpanel
* Flurry
* comScore DAX

If you have needs which are not addressed by the providers above, you can speak with Territory GM about using the Plugin architecture to build an integration with a new analytics provider. Doing so will support the native SDK functionality of that provider and the custom events referenced above.

Lastly, Applicaster also supports the following video analytics providers:

* comScore Stream Sense
* Akamai Media Analytics
