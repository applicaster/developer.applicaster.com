### General

This plugins was implemented in `Swift` on native side.
It also has a React Native module that exports it's view as React Native component.

`PlayerModule.swift` - `RCTViewManager` subclass that shares its view as a React native component.
`ReactNativeModulesExports.m` - Exported properties for the React Native view
`PlayerViewController.swift` -  Implamentation of the `AVPlayerViewController` instance
`Player.swift` - Base Player view implamentation
`Player+Source.swift` - Data Source of the player view implamentation
`Player+ReactViewManagement.swift` - React View Managment of the player view implamentation
`Player+Progress.swift` - Progress tracking for the player view implementation
`Player+Duration.swift`- Duration of the player view implamentation

### Configurable props

#### allowsExternalPlayback
Indicates whether the player allows switching to external playback mode such as AirPlay or HDMI.
* **true (default)** - allow switching to external playback mode
* **false** -  Don't allow switching to external playback mode

Platforms: iOS

#### audioOnly
Indicates whether the player should only play the audio track. In case Audio only is requested - the poster image will be displayed instead of a video track.
* **false (default)** - Display the video as normal
* **true** - Show the poster and play the audio

For this to work, the poster prop must be set.

Platforms: all

#### bufferConfig
Adjust the buffer settings. This prop takes an object with one or more of the properties listed below.

Property | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
minBufferMs | number | The default minimum duration of media that the player will attempt to ensure is buffered at all times, in milliseconds.
maxBufferMs | number | The default maximum duration of media that the player will attempt to buffer, in milliseconds.
bufferForPlaybackMs | number | The default duration of media that must be buffered for playback to start or resume following a user action such as a seek, in milliseconds.
playbackAfterRebufferMs | number | The default duration of media that must be buffered for playback to resume after a rebuffer, in milliseconds. A rebuffer is defined to be caused by buffer depletion rather than a user action.

This prop should only be set when you are setting the source, changing it after the media is loaded will cause it to be reloaded.

Example with default values:
```
bufferConfig={
  minBufferMs: 15000,
  maxBufferMs: 50000,
  bufferForPlaybackMs: 2500,
  bufferForPlaybackAfterRebufferMs: 5000
}
```
This is usually used to cut down delay for live streams mainly.

#### controls
Determines whether to show player controls.
* ** false (default)** - Don't show player controls
* **true** - Show player controls

Note on iOS, controls are always shown when in fullscreen mode.

Platforms: iOS, react-native-dom

#### filter
Add video filter
* **FilterType.NONE (default)** - No Filter
* **FilterType.INVERT** - CIColorInvert
* **FilterType.MONOCHROME** - CIColorMonochrome
* **FilterType.POSTERIZE** - CIColorPosterize
* **FilterType.FALSE** - CIFalseColor
* **FilterType.MAXIMUMCOMPONENT** - CIMaximumComponent
* **FilterType.MINIMUMCOMPONENT** - CIMinimumComponent
* **FilterType.CHROME** - CIPhotoEffectChrome
* **FilterType.FADE** - CIPhotoEffectFade
* **FilterType.INSTANT** - CIPhotoEffectInstant
* **FilterType.MONO** - CIPhotoEffectMono
* **FilterType.NOIR** - CIPhotoEffectNoir
* **FilterType.PROCESS** - CIPhotoEffectProcess
* **FilterType.TONAL** - CIPhotoEffectTonal
* **FilterType.TRANSFER** - CIPhotoEffectTransfer
* **FilterType.SEPIA** - CISepiaTone

For more details on these filters refer to the [iOS docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000136-SW55).

Notes:
1. Using a filter can impact CPU usage. A workaround is to save the video with the filter and then load the saved video.
2. Only on progressive download and locally served files (non HLS caching).

Platforms: iOS

#### fullscreen
Controls whether the player enters fullscreen on play.
* **false (default)** - Don't display the video in fullscreen
* **true** - Display the video in fullscreen

Platforms: iOS

#### fullscreenAutorotate
If a preferred [fullscreenOrientation](#fullscreenorientation) is set, causes the video to rotate to that orientation but permits rotation of the screen to orientation held by user. Defaults to TRUE.

Platforms: iOS

#### fullscreenOrientation

* **all (default)** -
* **landscape**

<br>Value: string with a URL for the poster, e.g. "https://baconmockup.com/300/200/"


#### posterResizeMode
Determines how to resize the poster image when the frame doesn't match the raw video dimensions.
* **"contain" (default)** - Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
* **"center"** - Center the image in the view along both dimensions. If the image is larger than the view, scale it down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.
* **"cover"** - Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
* **"none"** - Don't apply resize

Platforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS, Windows UWP

#### source
Sets the media source. You can pass an asset loaded via require or an object with a uri.

The docs for this prop are incomplete and will be updated as each option is investigated and tested.

##### Asset loaded via require

Example:
```
const sintel = require('./sintel.mp4');

source={sintel}
```

##### URI string

A number of URI schemes are supported by passing an object with a `uri` attribute.

###### Web address (http://, https://)

Example:
```
source={ uri: 'https://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_10mb.mp4' }
```

Platforms: all

###### File path (file://)

Example:
```
source={ uri: 'file:///sdcard/Movies/sintel.mp4' }
```

Note: Your app will need to request permission to read external storage if you're accessing a file outside your app.

Platforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, possibly others

###### iPod Library (ipod-library://)

Path to a sound file in your iTunes library. Typically shared from iTunes to your app.

Example:
```
source={ uri: 'ipod-library:///path/to/music.mp3' }
```

Note: Using this feature adding an entry for NSAppleMusicUsageDescription to your Info.plist file as described [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html)

Platforms: iOS

###### Other protocols

The following other types are supported on some platforms, but aren't fully documented yet:

  ]
}
```

Support for timed metadata on Android MediaPlayer is limited at best and only compatible with some videos. It requires a target SDK of 23 or higher.

Platforms: Android ExoPlayer, Android MediaPlayer, iOS

### Methods
Methods operate on a ref to the Video element. You can create a ref using code like:
```
return (
  <Video source={...}
    ref => (this.player = ref) />
);
```

#### dismissFullscreenPlayer
`dismissFullscreenPlayer()`

Take the player out of fullscreen mode.

Example:
```
this.player.dismissFullscreenPlayer();
```

Platforms: iOS

#### presentFullscreenPlayer
`presentFullscreenPlayer()`

Put the player in fullscreen mode.

On iOS, this displays the video in a fullscreen view controller with controls.

On Android ExoPlayer & MediaPlayer, this puts the navigation controls in fullscreen mode. It is not a complete fullscreen implementation, so you will still need to apply a style that makes the width and height match your screen dimensions to get a fullscreen video.

Example:
```
this.player.presentFullscreenPlayer();
```

Platforms: iOS

#### save
`save(): Promise`

Save video to your Photos with current filter prop. Returns promise.

Example:
```
let response = await this.save();
let path = response.uri;
```

Notes:
 - Currently only supports highest quality export
 - Currently only supports MP4 export
 - Currently only supports exporting to user's cache directory with a generated UUID filename.
 - User will need to remove the saved video through their Photos app
 - Works with cached videos as well. (Checkout video-caching example)
 - If the video is has not began buffering (e.g. there is no internet connection) then the save function will throw an error.
 - If the video is buffering then the save function promise will return after the video has finished buffering and processing.

Future:
 - Will support multiple qualities through options
 - Will support more formats in the future through options
 - Will support custom directory and file name through options

Platforms: iOS

#### seek()
`seek(seconds)`

Seek to the specified position represented by seconds. seconds is a float value.

`seek()` can only be called after the `onLoad` event has fired. Once completed, the [onSeek](#onseek) event will be called.

Example:
```
this.player.seek(200); // Seek to 3 minutes, 20 seconds
```

Platforms: all

##### Exact seek

By default iOS seeks within 100 milliseconds of the target position. If you need more accuracy, you can use the seek with tolerance method:

`seek(seconds, tolerance)`

tolerance is the max distance in milliseconds from the seconds position that's allowed. Using a more exact tolerance can cause seeks to take longer. If you want to seek exactly, set tolerance to 0.

Example:
```
this.player.seek(120, 50); // Seek to 2 minutes with +/- 50 milliseconds accuracy
```
