### Supported platforms[^1]

- [x] Samsung TV / DOM

### Contributing

The primary repo for cell builder plugins is [applicaster/demo-cell-builder-plugin](https://github.com/applicaster/demo-cell-builder-plugin). Please use it as a reference[^2] when creating a new plugin of the `cell_builder` type (clone, change manifest etc.). It is _highly recommended_ to follow this peculiar project structure, shown in details in the [plugin guide in Quickbrick](https://github.com/applicaster/QuickBrick/blob/master/DOCS/plugin-setup.md)
