Android plugins can be written with Java or Kotlin.

To be able to write Android native plugins, you will need to make sure you are setting your Android environment to:

* Android Studio version 3 and above.
* Work with build tools version `27.0.3`
* Set [Android plugin for Gradle](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/) version to `3.1.3`
* Set gradle version to `4.5.1`
* Kotlin version should be `1.2.0`
* Google play services should be `12.0.1`
* minSdkVersion - `17`
* compileSdkVersion = `27`

* Get access to the different Zapp Android libraries Maven repositories on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/) (you should just send your Bintray user to your Solution-Engineer).
