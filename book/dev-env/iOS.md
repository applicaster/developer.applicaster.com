# iOS

iOS plugins can be written with Swift or Objective C.

To be able to write iOS native plugins, you will need to make sure you are setting your iOS environment to:

* [Xcode version 9.4](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_9.4/Xcode_9.4.xip)
* Swift version `4.1`
* Make sure that your plugin is `bitcode enable`
* Install [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) version `1.5.3`
