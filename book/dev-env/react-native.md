# React Native

In order to work on React Native plugins, you will need nothing more than the [node.js](node.md) set up.

Some of our projects are using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Although this is not mandatory, we recommand you give it a try - You can then benefit from type definitions to help you implement reliable plugins.

## Versions

All plugins must use the same react & react-native version. You will get warnings in your project when an update will be needed.
Currently, we are relying on these versions :

- react@16.0.0
- react-native@0.50.4
