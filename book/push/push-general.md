# Push Provider Plugins

An Applicaster push plugin is used to implement a push provider SDK.
By wrapping the push provider logic inside a Applicaster plugin we give the ability to use it inside an Applicaster app.

We support the following platforms in terms of documentation and usage: 
* [iOS](push/push-ios.md)
* [Android](push/push-android.md)

## Public Examples
We have created a public Github repository plugin for [firebase](https://github.com/applicaster/zapp-push-plugin-firebase) for both iOS/Android, please refer to it while you develop your own push plugin.
