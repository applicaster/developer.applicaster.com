# Push Provider Plugins

An Applicaster push plugin is used to implement a push provider SDK.
By wrapping the push provider logic inside a Applicaster plugin we give the ability to use it inside an Applicaster app.

We support the following platforms in terms of documentation and usage: 
* [iOS](push/push-ios.md)
* [Android](push/push-android.md)
