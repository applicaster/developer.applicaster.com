# Zapp UI Builder

The Zapp UI Builder enables quick creation of apps, by designing screens using Components in a drag and drop manner, while linking feeds of various CMSs to each Component.

The Screens section of the Builder defines the UI of an app by enabling creation of screens, composing each one with Components and defining the visual language of each component using a Cell Style Family.

In the following chapters, the process of creating components and cell styles families is described per platform.
