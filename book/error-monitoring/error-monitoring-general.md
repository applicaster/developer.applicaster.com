# Error Monitoring Plugins

A Zapp Error Monitoring plugin is used to implement an error reporting provider SDK.

By wrapping the error reporting provider logic inside a Zapp plugin we give the ability to use it inside an Zapp app.

Please use one of the following guides in order to develop an error monitoring plugin for the relevant platform:
* [iOS](/error-monitoring/error-monitoring-ios.md)

We have created a public Github repository plugin for [Ms App Center](https://github.com/applicaster/ZappCrashlogsPluginMsAppCenter-iOS.git) on iOS, please refer to it while you develop your own error monitoring plugin.
