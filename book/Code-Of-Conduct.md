# Applicaster Developers Community - Code Of Conduct

* **Be friendly and patient**.

* **Be welcoming:** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

* **Be considerate:** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.

* **Be respectful:** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

* **Try to understand why we disagree:** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

* **Stand behind your words:** In our worldwide community, you will often work with other developer's or Applicaster clients, your colleagues and clients will expect you to `stand behind your words`, regarding code quality, product, and timelines. Of course, sometimes things changes, make sure that you communicate changes in specs or timelines properly.
