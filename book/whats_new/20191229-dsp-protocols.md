# DSP Protocols

This article will cover the changes we made to the documentation of datasource providers.

## Main Changes

1. Created a ["Protocols"](/Zapp-Pipes/11.-Protocols.md) page that lists all the protocols that datasource providers can implement to send data to the app.
2. Moved DSP Protocols for Video Players from the  `Player plugins` section to the new `Protocols` page.
3. Added documentation for datasource providers to send [Login and Payments](/Zapp-Pipes/protocols/login_and_payment_protocol.md) data to the app.
