#### 3.2 Zapp

- From UIBuilder, create a new Feed JSON with the URL, name it `Screen1-to-Screen2-Feed`
- Add `Screen 2` with a `Tab Bar` on it, no feed should be defined
- Add `Screen 1` with a `Hero` on it
- Connect the `Hero` to the screen target `Screen 2`
- Set the feed of `Hero` to be Feed JSON `Screen1-to-Screen2-Feed`

Now screen 1, shows a hero that points to screen 2 which contains the tabs with grid/list
