# Bridge API

As explained in the intro section of this documentation, Zapp-pipes bundles are evaluated inside a JS bridge which provides specific features to the Zapp-pipes bundles. For simplicity's sake, the bridge features are wrapped in a javascript toolbelt object which is injected in each provider's handler function.

The `nativeBridge` object provides the following methods :
* `log(...msg<[Any]>)`: logs a message. You can also use the browser's `console` object, and the `log`, `warn`, and `error` methods. 
* `throwError(reason<String>)`: will return a 500 response, with an `Error` object initialized with the `reason` message
* `sendResponse(response<Object>, code<Number> = 200)`: will return a response to the router, with the given http code (default is 200)
* `appData() -> <Object>` : function which returns data from the native app. returns an object with the following properties:
  * `uuid`: device uuid
  * `accountId`: Zapp account Id
  * `broadcasterId`: Applicaster broadcaster Id
  * `bundleIdentifier`: bundle identifier of the app
  * `platform`: android or ios
  * `ver`: version number of the app
* `fetch(url<String>[, options<Object>]) -> <Promise: Any>`: allows the provider to perform http get requests through the bridge. the `options` object is optional and allows to define headers, and other options. Returns a promise with the body of the response, and automatically responds with the `throwError` method if an exception is caught when making the request. Errors are thrown for all responses with a status code of `4XX` or `5XX`.
* `postData(url<String>, body<Any>[, options<Object>]) -> <Promise: Any>` : allows the provider to send data through a post request. Returns a promise with the body or the server response. 

The `fetch` and `postData` methods use the [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios/) library. See axios documentation for specific documentation about the options object.
