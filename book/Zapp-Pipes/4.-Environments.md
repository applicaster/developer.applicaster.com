-- WIP --
In the native apps, the zapp-pipes project offers two environments : 

## production
Production is the default environment. It relies on a bundle built with the zapp-pipes-packager, hosted on s3.

## Local
The local environment will fetch a bundle served locally on localhost instead of getting it from s3.
The local bundle can be either : 
- a bundle containing all the providers, if you use the `zapp-pipes` repo with the `npm run start:script` feature
- a bundle containing one provider, with hot reloading of the js code (more info coming soon)

When creating a new provider, it is also possible to use the server feature of the `zapp-pipes-dev-kit` to locally test a provider requests in the browser
