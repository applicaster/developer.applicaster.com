The Zapp Pipes project is the new data loader mechanism for applicaster zapp apps, which enables data source plugins.

## For the Team working on Reshet-first
This documentation is being updated. We left the two pages relevant for you guys here : 
- [Project structure](https://github.com/applicaster/Zapp-Pipes/wiki/Project-structure)
- [How to update a provider](https://github.com/applicaster/Zapp-Pipes/wiki/How-to-update-a-provider-%3F)

## Purpose of this project
Zapp pipes has several objectives : 
* Allow apps to have multiple and external datasources
* decoupling the app from applicaster2
* have a shared management of datasources across platforms

You can use Zapp-pipes if you need multiple pluggable datasources for your app. This wiki explains the overall Architecture of the project And documents the different parts of it.

Browse this wiki to know more about the project and how to use it.
