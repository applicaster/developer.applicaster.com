# Prerequisites

In this section, you will find information about the required tools and concepts to create a new provider

## Tools & Environment
### node.js
To create and test a new provider, you will need node.js v6.9.1 or later, and npm v4 or later. 

### ECMAScript version
While Zapp-pipes requires a recent version of node.js, the provider code needs to be transpiled in ES5 compatible javascript code. Hence, it is required to either write ES5 compliant code, or transpile ES6/7 code to ES5 using a transpiler like [babel.js](http://babeljs.io/).

### npm modules
Providers are distributed as [npm](http://npmjs.org) modules. You can either create a publicly available package, or ask Applicaster team to provide an NPM token and have a private module. if you decide to do so, your npm package name must be prefixed with `@applicaster/zapp-pipes-provider-`

[See here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/creating-node-modules) to learn more about creating an npm package. You can also access starter code [here](https://github.com/applicaster/zapp-pipes-provider-starter-kit)

In order to create a private package, you need to ask an NPM token to your applicaster representative. You also need to [add a `.npmrc` file](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/118393368555/deploying-with-npm-private-modules) to your project to use this NPM token and enable access to applicaster private packages
