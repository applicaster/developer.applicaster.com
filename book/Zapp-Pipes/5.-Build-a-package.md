You can use the `zapp-pipes-packager` to create a bundle for a specific app-version, with just the providers which are required. 

For this you will need an NPM_TOKEN and a ZAPP_TOKEN to be set in your environment variables. The ZAPP_TOKEN can be created in https://accounts.applicaster.com. Ask for the NPM_TOKEN on [slack](https://applicaster.slack.com/archives/C4W2MEQMB)

You will also need the aws cli to be installed and configured properly.

In order to do so : 
* clone the [`zapp-pipes-packager`](https://github.com/applicaster/zapp-pipes-packager) repo. make sure you are using the latest master code
* install dependencies by running `yarn`
* run `npm run package [app_version_id] provider1 provider2 ...`

You can head to the `zapp-pipes-packager` README for more detailed information about this process
