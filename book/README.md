## Welcome to Zapp documentation book

Zapp is app management and development platform, made by Applicaster.
Zapp enable users to configure and build media apps with **remote configuration** (assets, styles, fonts and localized strings), **layout** (templates or [**UI Builder**](/ui-builder/intro.md)), and **client-side plugins**.

This portal will help you create new products that would integrate into the Zapp platform to further expand your mobile and connected tv apps.

Most of the capabilities are added through **plugins**.
Each one of those plugins is a bundle of code on one or more platforms that expands the capabilities of your apps.

You can find guides here to further expand your products and to build, maintain, debug and integrate capabilities into existing and new apps.

Zapp apps are built from the [Zapp CMS](http://zapp.applicaster.com) and the client-side SDKs -  Android, iOS, tvOS, AndroidTV, Roku.
