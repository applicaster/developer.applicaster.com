# Deploy and submit and plugin

Deploying and submitting your plugin to zapp includes two main steps:

1. Deploy your plugin to a dependency manager. We are using Maven for [Android](/getting-started/set-up-bintray-and-circle-ci.md) and CocoaPods for [iOS](/getting-started/ios-podspec.md).
2. Submit your plugin to Zapp by the [plugin manifest](/zappifest/plugins-manifest-format.md) and the [zappifest cli tool](/zappifest/zappifest.md).
